#  House Prices Prediction with Linear Regression

##  Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **predict house prices** using linear regression. 
This project is inspired by an exercise from the first course of the **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

##  Project Content

This project includes **two Jupyter notebooks**:

1. `House_Price_Prediction_Manually.ipynb`  
   Implements a linear regression algorithm **from scratch** using NumPy.

2. `House_Price_Prediction_Sklearn.ipynb`  
   Uses the library **Scikit-Learn** to train and evaluate a linear regression model on the same dataset.

##  Dataset

The `AmesHousing.csv` dataset includes features such as:

- `Gr Liv Area` (Ground living area)
- `Neighborhood`
- `Year Built`
- `Yr Sold`

##  Requirements

On **Google Colab**, the following libraries are required (installable via `!pip install`):

- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

If running locally, you can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
