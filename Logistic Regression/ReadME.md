#  Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

##  Project Goal

The goal of this project is to **classify** tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using a logistic regression model. 
This project is inspired by an exercise from the first course of the **Machine Learning Specialization** on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

##  Project Content

This project includes **one Jupyter notebooks**:

- `Breast_Cancer_Prediction.ipynb`  
   Jupyter notebook implementing model training and evaluation using **Scikit-Learn**.


---

##  Dataset

The dataset used is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, which contains:

- Features computed from digitized images of breast mass (e.g., radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness).
- Target variable `diagnosis`:
  - `M` = malignant
  - `B` = benign

##  Requirements

On **Google Colab**, the following libraries are required (installable via `!pip install`):

- numpy  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

If running locally, you can install the dependencies using:
